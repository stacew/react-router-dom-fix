# react-router-dom-fix

- My personal react-router-dom adapter, only a few available.

- I did this because I didn't want the navigate function in the GNB menu to keep re-rendering when the URL sub-address changed.
- If the address changes, `useNavigate()` will not invoke the re-render.

### `Warning: I haven't had any problems yet, but you have to be careful. `

- In problematic situations, you can use `useNavigate()` instead of `useNavigatefix()`.
